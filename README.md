## 01. Arithmetic & Variables(Python Basics) 
### Overview
This exercise introduces the fundamental concepts of Python programming for data science. It focuses on using Python to perform basic calculations, print outputs, write comments, and work with variables. The goal is to build a strong foundation for later data analysis and machine learning tasks.
### Key Concepts Covered
- **Printing output**  
  Learned how to use the `print()` function to display text and calculation results.
- **Arithmetic operations**  
  Performed basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation, while understanding the order of operations (PEMDAS).
- **Comments**  
  Used comments (`#`) to document code behavior, improving readability and helping with future maintenance and debugging.
- **Variables**  
  Created and assigned values to variables, updated variable values, and reused variables across multiple code cells.
- **Working with multiple variables**  
  Used several variables together to perform longer, more readable calculations, such as estimating the number of seconds in multiple years.
- **Debugging basics**  
  Identified and fixed common errors such as `NameError` caused by misspelled variable names.
### Practical Example
A multi-variable calculation was used to estimate the total number of seconds in four years. The exercise demonstrated how variables make calculations easier to understand, modify, and debug, including updating assumptions (e.g., accounting for leap years).
### Intro to Programming Exercise → First Kaggle Competition
### Overview
The exercise introduced the basics of running Python code in a Jupyter notebook environment and served as my entry point into Kaggle-based data science workflows. The focus was on building confidence with code execution, simple calculations, variables, and interpreting outputs.
### Applied Learning with Real Data
The exercise progressed from basic Python syntax to working with a real dataset from the **Titanic Kaggle competition**. Using preloaded data, I:
- Explored passenger-level data using pandas
- Calculated summary statistics (total passengers, survivors, minors)
- Computed meaningful proportions such as survival rate and fraction of minors
### Transition to First Competition
This exercise concluded by encouraging a full submission to the Titanic competition. It provided a practical bridge between introductory programming concepts and applied data science, directly leading to my first experience building a model and submitting predictions on Kaggle.
### Outcome
By completing this exercise, I gained foundational Python skills and hands-on exposure to the Kaggle ecosystem, setting the stage for deeper work in data analysis and machine learning.
### Overall Outcome
By completing this exercise, I developed foundational Python skills required for data analysis workflows, including clear code structure, basic debugging, and effective use of variables. These skills form the basis for progressing to data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks in later projects.

## 02. Functions in Python
### Overview
This exercise introduced the use of functions to organize code into reusable blocks. Functions were used to perform calculations without duplicating code, improving clarity, efficiency, and reliability.
### Key Concepts Learned
- Defining functions using `def`
- Function arguments and return values
- Calling functions with different inputs
- Writing reusable code to avoid repetition
- Understanding variable scope (local vs global variables)
- Creating functions with multiple arguments and no arguments
### Practical Examples
- A simple function that adds a constant value to an input
- A function to calculate weekly pay after taxes
- Extending functions to accept flexible inputs such as hourly wage and tax rate
- Demonstrating how function scope limits access to internal variables
### Learning Outcome
By completing this exercise, I gained foundational skills in writing modular, reusable Python code—an essential skill for scalable data analysis and machine learning workflows.
### Personal Practice: House Price Cost Function
- Implemented a custom Python function to estimate house prices using bedroom and bathroom counts
- Applied fixed baseline cost and incremental pricing logic
- Used function calls to compare multiple housing options efficiently
- Reinforced concepts of function arguments, return values, and code reuse
- Practiced applying programming logic to a real-world, competition-inspired scenario
